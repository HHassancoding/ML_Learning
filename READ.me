My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects Repository**!  
This repo documents my personal learning journey in **applied machine learning** — each project focuses on building intuition for key ML concepts, working with real datasets, and experimenting with different models.

## 📘 Projects

### ⚽ 1. Fantasy Goal Predictor (Gradient Boosting Classifier)
**Goal:** Predict which football players are most likely to score in their next game based on their recent stats.

#### 🧠 Skills Learned:
- Data preprocessing with **Pandas**
- Creating a custom target feature (`Likely`)
- Train/test split and model evaluation
- Using **GradientBoostingClassifier** for prediction
- Handling categorical variables with encoding

#### ⚙️ Technologies:
Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
*(Dataset: Kaggle – Football Player Stats)*

#### 📈 Example Features:
- `goals_scored`
- `expected_goals_per_90`
- `assists`
- `minutes`
- `expected_assists_per_90`

#### 🚀 Model:
```python
GradientBoostingClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=4
)
✅ Result:
The model achieved solid predictive performance, showing how player stats like xG and minutes played can forecast upcoming goal likelihood — similar to metrics used in fantasy football or sports analytics tools.

🎬 2. Improved Streaming Project (Random Forest on Kaggle Dataset)
Goal: Predict whether a user “Liked” a movie (rating ≥ 4) using a dataset of movie metadata and user ratings.

🧠 Skills Learned:
Merging multiple CSVs and cleaning large datasets

Feature engineering (genre extraction, popularity, votes)

Applying a RandomForestClassifier

Analyzing feature importance

Visualizing results with Matplotlib

⚙️ Technologies:
Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, ast
(Dataset: Kaggle – Movies Metadata & Ratings)

📊 Model:
python
Copy code
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=300,
    max_depth=None,
    random_state=42
)
📈 Key Features:
Genre indicators (Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.)

Popularity

Vote count

✅ Result:
The model achieved strong accuracy and revealed which movie features most influence positive user ratings.
This simulates how streaming platforms like Netflix or Spotify personalize recommendations.

🧩 What I’m Learning Next
Model tuning and hyperparameter optimization

Feature scaling and normalization

Streamlit dashboards for visual ML demos

Neural networks and deep learning basics
